Overview
---
The purpose of this project is to create a classifier for traffic signs. The model is trained and validated with the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). 

## Model Architecture
The model is based on VGG. It achieves an accuracy of 95% on the validation set.
